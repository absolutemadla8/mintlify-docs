# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get started with the Often Trips API to integrate travel booking functionality into your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

1. **API Key**: Request an API key by contacting [support@often-travel.com](mailto:support@often-travel.com)
2. **Development Environment**: A development environment with the ability to make HTTP requests
3. **Authentication**: Understand the authentication process (see [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication))

## Step 1: Authentication

The first step is to authenticate with the API to obtain an access token:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.often-travel.com/api/auth/send-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phone": "9876543210",
    "country_code": "+91"
  }'
```

This will return a reference_id that you'll use to verify the OTP:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.often-travel.com/api/auth/verify-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reference_id": "abc123def456",
    "otp": "123456"
  }'
```

Upon successful verification, you'll receive an authentication token:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "OTP verified successfully",
  "token": "YOUR_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-uuid",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "9876543210"
  }
}
```

## Step 2: Explore Available Trips

Now, you can start exploring available trips:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.often-travel.com/api/trips?limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN"
```

This will return a list of available trips:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "trip-uuid-1",
      "name": "Magical Rajasthan Tour",
      "description": "Experience the royal heritage of Rajasthan",
      "price": 65000,
      "discounted_price": 59000,
      "currency": "INR",
      "nights": 7,
      // ...more trip details
    },
    // ...more trips
  ],
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "from": 1,
    "last_page": 5,
    "path": "/api/trips",
    "per_page": 5,
    "to": 5,
    "total": 25
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Get Trip Details

To get detailed information about a specific trip:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.often-travel.com/api/trips/trip-uuid-1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN"
```

## Step 4: Create a Trip Session

Before booking, create a trip session to hold information about the traveler's preferences:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.often-travel.com/api/trips/session" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "trip_id": "trip-uuid-1",
    "trip_date_id": "date-uuid-1",
    "adults": 2,
    "children": 1,
    "room_configurations": [
      {
        "adults": 2,
        "child_ages": [8]
      }
    ]
  }'
```

This will create a session and return pricing information:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "session_id": "session-uuid",
  "expires_at": "2023-11-01T12:00:00Z",
  "pricing": {
    "base_price": 65000,
    "discounted_price": 59000,
    "tax_amount": 0,
    "total_amount": 59000,
    "currency": "INR"
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Create an Order

Finally, create an order to complete the booking:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.often-travel.com/api/orders/create" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "trip_session_id": "session-uuid",
    "payment_method": "razorpay",
    "guest_details": {
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "phone": "9876543210"
    }
  }'
```

This will return order details including payment information:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "order": {
    "id": "order-uuid",
    "reference_number": "OT-123456",
    "status": "pending_payment",
    "total_amount": 59000,
    "currency": "INR"
  },
  "payment": {
    "gateway": "razorpay",
    "order_id": "razorpay_order_123456",
    "amount": 59000,
    "currency": "INR",
    "key_id": "rzp_test_123456789"
  }
}
```
